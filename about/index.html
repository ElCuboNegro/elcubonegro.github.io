              I have always supported the idea of Robert Venturi about maximixalism, 
              “Less is a bore.”, however I try to build digital experiences that helps 
              people instead of `just` being a beautiful piece of art.</p

            <p>
              I'm also a true believer of the idea that the best way to learn is by teaching,
              the best way to improve something is allowing others to criticize it, and the best way
              to grow is by helping others grow. (AKA, design beautiful OpenAPIs and allow other to build on top of your products)
